    <h2><strong>History</strong></h2>
    <h4><strong><em>World War I</em></strong></h4>
    <p>In August 1914, when World War I broke out, Romania declared neutrality. Two years later, under the pressure of the Allies (especially France desperate to open a new front), on 14/27 August 1916 it joined the Allies, for which Romania was promised support for the accomplishment of national unity, including recognition of Romanian rights over Transylvania (which was at that time part of Austria-Hungary); Romania declared war on Austria-Hungary.[69]</p>
    <p>By the 1920 Treaty of Trianon, Hungary renounced in favour of Romania all the claims of the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy over Transylvania.[</p>
    <h4><strong><em>Greater Romania (1918-1940)</em></strong></h4>
    <p>The Romanian expression România Mare (literal translation "Great Romania", but more commonly rendered "Greater Romania") generally refers to the Romanian state in the interwar period, and by extension, to the territory Romania covered at the time. Romania achieved at that time its greatest territorial extent (almost 300,000 km2 or 120,000 sq mi), managing to unite all the historic Romanian lands.</p>
    <h4><strong><em>World War II</em></strong></h4>
    <p>During the Second World War, Romania tried again to remain neutral, but on 28 June 1940, it received a Soviet ultimatum with an implied threat of invasion in the event of non-compliance. Under pressure from Moscow and Berlin, the Romanian administration and the army were forced to retreat from Bessarabia as well from Northern Bukovina to avoid war.</p>
    <p>The Paris Peace Treaty at the end of World War II rendered the Vienna Awards void: Northern Transylvania returned to Romania, but Bessarabia, northern Bukovina and southern Dobruja were not recovered. The Moldavian-SSR became independent of the Soviet Union only with the latter's 1991 demise and turned into the Republic of Moldova.</p>
    <h2><strong>Culture</strong></h2>
    <p>The Romanian language currently spoken by over 25-milion people is 1,700 years old.</p>
    <p>Romania is a member of the Francophonie, an organization of governments that use French as their primary language or have a special affiliation with the French language or culture.</p>
    <p>Romanian is one of the five languages in which religious services are performed in the autonomous monastic state of Mount Athos (Greece).</p>
    <p>Most Romanians are of Christian faith. The oldest church still standing – Densus Church (St. Nicholas')– was built in 600s, in Transylvania, on the site of a 2nd-century Roman temple. Ruins of a mid-300s Christian worship building were found in north-eastern Romania in the town of Mihalaseni (Botosani county).</p>
