            <h3><strong>Matchday Child Mascot Policy</strong></h3>
            <p>Children between the age of 6 and 12 years old act as mascots for the Chelsea team before each home and away game.  A waiting list operates for children to become mascots.  New names are added in the order in which applications are received, we cannot give a definite wait time.  The length of the waiting list should be considered when making an application. For instance, a 10-year-old would not currently be added as the child will not reach the top of the list before reaching the age limit.</p>
